The website has the main index.html page. After that, it branches into a few movies, such as Free Guy, Mars Attack, Dune, Donnie Darko and Inception. 
All these when clicked allow you to see some basic information about the movie. 

The website has panels that expand. These panels are design to hold a home button on the branches of the website. While the main website does not have any button, 
has buttons to the movies via a list. 

Once clicked on, it opens up the branch website. In here, we have an Open Panel that allows you to go back to the home page. While this is not the most 
Convenient, and will be subject to change, it allows a user to go back to the home page. 
In the form.html, we have a button that sends information to the backend and displays the information on the HTML website. It also has a 
back button that will just bring you back to the home page. 

The website can also be found: http://sotd.us/jorgeeligio/Mobile/CourseProject/index.html
